# Background:
In this challenge I used javascript and HTML to showcase Eathquakes with magnitude 2.5 or > occuring in the past 7 days.
  - The logic.js file contains the javascript code written for this activity.
  - Style.css contains custom legend style formatting.
  - This code creates a dropdown menu, bar chart, and bubble chart to help users interpret the data.
# File Structure:
The main directory contains the html code that makes up the webpage.
The static folder contains the app.js file used in the activity. 
# Future Changes:
I want to add multiple datasets and allow users to toggle between Earthquakes in the past 24 horus, 7 days, or Month.
I plan to add clusters for quakes that are clustered together.
